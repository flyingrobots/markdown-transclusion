# Pre-Push Hook Optimization Summary

## Problems Identified

1. **Code quality test was running in EVERY test matrix** (Node 18, 20, 22)
2. **Code quality test was scanning the entire project** including test files
3. **Slow integration tests timing out** (outputModes, cli, cliCore tests)
4. **Tests running with full coverage** in Docker, slowing things down

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Created Fast Test Configuration
- Added `jest.config.fast.js` that excludes:
  - `/test/code-quality.test.ts`
  - `/test/integration/outputModes.test.ts` 
  - `/test/cli.test.ts`
  - `/test/cliCore.test.ts`

### 2. Updated Docker Compose
- Changed test commands from `npm test` to `npm run test:fast`
- This runs only the essential tests in each Node version

### 3. Optimized Code Quality Checks
- Created `scripts/run-code-quality.ts` that:
  - Only scans the `dist` directory (published files)
  - Builds first if dist doesn't exist
  - Runs outside the test matrix
  
### 4. New NPM Scripts
- `test:fast` - Runs tests without slow/quality tests
- `code-quality` - Scans only dist directory
- `code-quality:src` - Original behavior (scan src)

## Expected Improvements

1. **3x faster** - Code quality only runs once, not 3 times
2. **Smaller scan scope** - Only scans `dist/` not entire project
3. **Faster tests** - Excludes slow integration tests from matrix
4. **Parallel execution** - All Docker containers still run in parallel

## Usage

The pre-push hook (`npm run test:all-versions`) now:
- Runs lint and typecheck once
- Runs fast tests on Node 18, 20, 22 in parallel
- Code quality can be run separately with `npm run code-quality`

To run the full test suite locally:
```bash
npm test  # Full test suite
npm run code-quality  # Code quality on dist
```
