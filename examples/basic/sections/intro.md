This project is a demonstration of markdown transclusion capabilities. It shows how you can:

- Include content from other files
- Build modular documentation
- Support multiple languages
- Extract specific sections
- Create reusable content

The transclusion syntax `![[filename]]` allows you to maintain DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) documentation.
