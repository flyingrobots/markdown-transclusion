## Overview

Validate Mermaid diagram syntax within transcluded content to ensure diagrams render correctly in the final output.

## User Story

As a technical documentation author, I want to validate Mermaid diagrams during transclusion so that I can catch syntax errors before publishing.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Detect Mermaid code blocks in transcluded content
- [ ] Validate diagram syntax without rendering
- [ ] Report syntax errors with line numbers
- [ ] Support all major Mermaid diagram types
- [ ] Optional: Auto-fix common syntax issues

## Notes

- Could use mermaid-js parser for validation
- Integration with code quality checks
- Consider PlantUML and other diagram formats
- Performance: Only validate if requested via flag
- Could extend to validate code blocks in other languages
