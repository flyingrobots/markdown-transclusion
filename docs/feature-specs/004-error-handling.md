## Overview

Comprehensive error reporting system with graceful degradation, allowing continued processing while collecting detailed error information for debugging.

## User Story

As a developer integrating the library, I want comprehensive error reporting so that I can debug transclusion issues efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Clear error messages for missing files
- [x] Circular reference detection with path trace
- [x] Optional verbose logging for debugging
- [x] Graceful degradation (continues processing on errors)

## Notes

- Error accumulation in `.errors[]` array on TransclusionResult
- Inline error comments in output for visibility
- Log levels: ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG
- Strict mode available to fail fast on errors
- Test coverage: See `tests/index.test.ts` for error handling scenarios
