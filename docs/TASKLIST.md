	- [ ]	Recursive includes (depth > 1)
	- [ ]	Missing files (warn mode)
	- [ ]	Multilingual substitutions ({{lang}})
	- [ ]	Circular references
	- [ ]	Assert that streamed output matches expected merged Markdown
	- [ ]	Confirm cache hits/misses are reported if enabled

âœ… Commit 2: CLI Interface Core
	- [ ]	Create src/cli.ts with shebang: #!/usr/bin/env node
	- [ ]	Parse CLI arguments manually (no deps):

	- [ ]	Read input from file or stdin
	- [ ]	Write output to file or stdout
	- [ ]	Wire CLI to TransclusionStream
	- [ ]	Pipe errors to stderr on failure

âœ… Commit 3: CLI Test Coverage
	- [ ]	Create tests/cli/cli.test.ts
	- [ ]	Use Nodeâ€™s child_process.spawnSync to simulate CLI calls
	- [ ]	Test combinations:
	- [ ]	stdin to stdout
	- [ ]	file to stdout
	- [ ]	stdin to file
	- [ ]	--vars usage
	- [ ]	--strict vs default (warn)
	- [ ]	--validate mode (no output, just exit code)

ðŸ“‚ PHASE 2: Advanced Handling & Enhancements

âœ… Commit 4: Relative Includes within Transcluded Files
	- [ ]	Modify resolver to optionally support relative references inside included files
	- [ ]	Add parentPathStack to track nesting context
	- [ ]	Resolve paths relative to parent if resolveRelativesFromParent is enabled
	- [ ]	Document behavior and update tests

Commit message: feat(resolver): support relative includes within nested transclusions

âœ… Commit 5: Circular Reference Chain Reporting
	- [ ]	Track file inclusion stack (visitedFiles with order)
	- [ ]	On loop detection, throw error with clear path trace
	- [ ]	Example: Circular reference: A.md â†’ B.md â†’ A.md
	- [ ]	Update recursive tests to assert error message content

Commit message: feat(transclude): detect and trace circular transclusion chains

âœ… Commit 6: Markdown Snippet Extraction (Optional)
	- [ ]	Parse syntax like ![[file#heading]]
	- [ ]	Extract only that heading and its content (until next heading of same/higher level)
	- [ ]	Fallback if heading not found (warn or strict)
