âœ… markdown-transclusion Remaining Task List (Post-Refactor Phase)

This list aligns with the current implementation state and requirements from tech-plan.md.

**COMPLETED WORK:**
- âœ… Core file reading with UTF-8 validation and BOM handling
- âœ… In-memory file cache implementation (now optional)
- âœ… Parser for transclusion references
- âœ… Path resolver with variable substitution (fully modularized)
- âœ… Security validation for path traversal
- âœ… Stream-based transclusion processing
- âœ… Line processor integration
- âœ… NoopFileCache implementation for opt-in caching strategy
- âœ… CLI implementation with argument parsing and structured logging
- âœ… CLI test coverage with POSIX compliance
- âœ… Type system cleanup and renaming for clarity
- âœ… Comprehensive mock infrastructure for testing

**RECENT REFACTORING ACHIEVEMENTS:**
- âœ… Quest 1: Modularized path resolution (pathTokens.ts, extensionResolver.ts)
- âœ… Quest 2: Improved CLI with proper argument parsing and logging
- âœ… Quest 4: Cleaned up types (renamed for clarity, no dead code)
- âœ… Side Quest: Built comprehensive mock testing infrastructure

âœ… Task 2: Implement Recursive Transclusion
	- [ ]	Modify LineTranscluder to support recursive processing
